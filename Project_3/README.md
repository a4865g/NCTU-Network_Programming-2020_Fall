# Project 3: Remote Batch System

- In this project, you are going to design the remote batch system and the project is divided into two parts:

1. Remote batch system in **N****P Linux Workstation**
2. Remote batch system in **Windows 10 (use a [MinGW distribution](https://nuwen.net/mingw.html))**

- To succeed in this project, we recommended you to do this project in the following order:

1. See ***\*NP_Project3_Spec_Part1.pdf\**** and ***\**\*NP_Project3_Spec_Part2.pdf.\*\**\***
2. Check **np_single_golden** given in **extra_files.zip** (path: extra_files/np_single_golden) can be executed.
3. Refer to the CGI samples given in **extra_files.zip** (path: extra_files/cgi/) and make sure it can be executed (e.g., chmod +x panel.cgi).
4. Make sure you can compile and run **echo_server.cpp** (path: /extra_files/boost asio example/echo_server.cpp)**.**
5. Implement **http_server**.
6. Implement **console.cgi**.
7. Migrate to Windows 10 and implement **cgi_server.exe** (part 2).
